Published in : Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis

Description : 'Performs a logit model using the Lasso methodology. The estimates become nonzero at
a point that means the variables enter the model equation sequentially as the shrinkage parameter
increases. The Lasso technique results in variable selection. Finally, the resulting Lasso
estimates and predictions are plotted'
